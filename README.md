assignment-3 react

This assignment is quite similar to the medicine assignment. I have made a series of components that toghether render a list of expenses and summarizes them. The input form has validation for empty fields and I added a validation to prohibit expenses that are forward in time. This also prevents putting in a date with too many zeroes as 20240 is a long ways from now. 
The data is stored in localStorage so it is availible despite refreshing.
